From Spring:
- Parsing is not finished or up to date
- I noticed that there were quite a few 'if/else if' blocks in the parser which
      did not have an 'else' fail condition when there needed to be one.
- A proper test script would be nice, that is why I added the 'test' folder

- Fix segfault when run against examples/test.mz
