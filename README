This is the repository for Dr. Meehan's Muze language project.


Setup
-----

Clone the repository:

   $ git clone git@gitlab.cs.wwu.edu:covinga/language-design-research.git


Then run the configuration script:

   $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir


I usually just set my prefix to /home/covinga/.local/ and let autotools
create the bin/, lib/, and script/ directories.

Lastly, build and install it:

   $ make
   $ make install


Make sure you set your PATH to point to the newly generated binary!
