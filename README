This is the repository for Dr. Meehan's Muze language project.


Setup
-----

Clone the repository:

   $ git clone git@gitlab.cs.wwu.edu:covinga/language-design-research.git


Then run the configuration script:

   $ ./configure


If you don't have sudo on your machine, you can have the configure script
install it to a local directory:

   $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/dir


I usually just set my prefix to /home/covinga/.local/ and let autotools
create the bin/, lib/, include/, and script/ directories in the install
location.

Lastly, build and install it:

   $ make
   $ make install


Make sure you set your $PATH to point to the newly generated binary!


Usage
-----

If the installation was successful, you should now have the binary muzec,
which is the Muze compiler. You can run it on any muze file:

   $ muzec -o hello hello.mz


For a more detailed help menu:

   $ muzec -h


The rest of the documentation can be found in the docs/ directory.


C Extensions
------------

That's right, Muze supports C extensions! You just need to include the muze.h
in your C project and link the Muze standard library. The muze.h header file
will be in the $(prefix)/include/ and libmuze.a will be in $(prefix)/lib/.
GCC can link these by doing the following:

   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/muze/lib # only necessary if you didn't install globally
   $ gcc -c -o myextension.o myextension.c -lmuze

More detailed documentation coming soon. This feature is still WIP.
