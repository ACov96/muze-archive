From Spring:
- Parsing is not finished or up to date
- I noticed that there were quite a few 'if/else if' blocks in the parser which
      did not have an 'else' fail condition when there needed to be one.
- A proper test script would be nice, that is why I added the 'test' folder

CODEGEN
- Conditional
- Better label naming based on module/function scope
  This will probably mean we need a __main__ function
- Alg expressions
- Bool expressions
- Logical expressions
- Bitwise expressions
- Loop statement
- Case statement
- Records and arrays
- Morphs?
- Closures?
